# üî• Firewall Rules (Basic Setup)

I currently have a simple set of firewall rules configured in OPNsense. These were based on a tutorial from *The Home Network Guy* and are meant to get things up and running safely while I work on tighter policies.

### Configured Zones:
- **LAN**: General internal traffic
- **WAN**: Basic external access with NAT
- **WireGuard**: VPN traffic for remote access

Right now, rules are very permissive for initial setup and testing. I plan to revisit this soon and:
- Lock down access between LAN, Guest, and IoT networks
- Add logging and monitoring to sensitive ports
- Apply tighter control to VPN connections

Stay tuned ‚Äî more robust security coming soon!
