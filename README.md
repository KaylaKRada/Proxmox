# 🖥️ Kayla’s Proxmox Home Server Lab  
**Project Type:** Home Lab / Infrastructure  
**Created by:** Kayla Rada  

---

## ✨ Overview  
This is my custom-built Proxmox home lab—a personal project where I’ve assembled, configured, and deployed an entire server setup using real hardware and open-source tools. Right now, it powers my home network with an OPNsense firewall/router, a switch, and a TP-Link router I converted into a wireless access point.

I built the physical machine from individual components, and I’m running Proxmox VE to host virtual machines and experiment with networking, security, and services like document management and file sharing.

This lab is a huge step forward for me—it bridges everything I’ve learned about hardware, networking, and system administration into one hands-on, always-evolving project.

## 🧱 Current Setup  
- **Hypervisor:** Proxmox VE  
- **Firewall/Router:** OPNsense  
- **Switch:** Unmanaged 1Gbps  
- **Access Point:** TP-Link Router (converted to AP mode)  
- **Network:** LAN segmented with VLANs (coming soon)  

---

## 🚧 Goals & Future Plans  
- Host a Paperless-NGX document system  
- Set up internal DNS and VLAN segmentation  
- Experiment with backups, snapshots, and HA  
- Add Pi-hole, Nginx Proxy Manager, or Docker VMs

## 🧾 Documentation  
- `hardware-specs.md` – Full breakdown of parts used  
- `proxmox-config/` – Notes on VM templates and storage  
- `opnsense-config/` – My firewall rules and network setup  
- `access-point-setup.md` – How I reconfigured my TP-Link router

## 🛠️ Why It Matters  
This project combines everything I love about tech: problem-solving, hands-on hardware, and building systems that actually do something useful. It’s also a great place for me to test out new tools and grow my skills in networking, virtualization, and home infrastructure.
